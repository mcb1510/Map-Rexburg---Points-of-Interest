# Overview

This map will show the user 20 points of interest (these can be restaurants, public parks, or sports fields) in the city of Rexburg. The user can click on any of these points and information about that place will be displayed. The user also can see he/she current location and choose to either use a Navigation or Imagery Hybrid type of map. All the locations, names, and information were taken from google.

I created this map to get a basic knowledge on Javascrip, HTML, and the ArcGIS library.
